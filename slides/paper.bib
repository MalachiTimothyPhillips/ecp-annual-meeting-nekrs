	abstract = {A hybrid Schwarz/multigrid method for spectral element solvers to the Poisson equation in R2 is presented. It extends the additive Schwarz method studied by J. Lottes and P. Fischer (J. Sci. Comput. 24:45–78, 2005) by introducing nonuniform weight distributions based on the smoothed sign function. Using a V-cycle with only one pre-smoothing, the new method attains logarithmic convergence rates in the range from 1.2 to 1.9, which corresponds to residual reductions of almost two orders of magnitude. Compared to the original method, it reduces the iteration count by a factor of 1.5 to 3, leading to runtime savings of about 50 percent. In numerical experiments the method proved robust with respect to the mesh size and polynomial orders up to 32. Used as a preconditioner for the (inexact) CG method it is also suited for anisotropic meshes and easily extended to diﬀusion problems with variable coeﬃcients.},

	abstract = {We present a comparison of different multigrid approaches for the solution of systems arising from high-order continuous finite element discretizations of elliptic partial differential equations on complex geometries. We consider the pointwise Jacobi, the Chebyshev-accelerated Jacobi, and the symmetric successive over-relaxation smoothers, as well as elementwise block Jacobi smoothing. Three approaches for the multigrid hierarchy are compared: (1) high-order h-multigrid, which uses high-order interpolation and restriction between geometrically coarsened meshes; (2) p-multigrid, in which the polynomial order is reduced while the mesh remains unchanged, and the interpolation and restriction incorporate the different-order basis functions; and (3) a first-order approximation multigrid preconditioner constructed using the nodes of the high-order discretization. This latter approach is often combined with algebraic multigrid for the low-order operator and is attractive for high-order discretizations on unstructured meshes, where geometric coarsening is difficult. Based on a simple performance model, we compare the computational cost of the different approaches. Using scalar test problems in two and three dimensions with constant and varying coefficients, we compare the performance of the different multigrid approaches for polynomial orders up to 16. Overall, both h-multigrid and p-multigrid work well; the first-order approximation is less efficient. For constant coefficients, all smoothers work well. For variable coefficients, Chebyshev and symmetric successive over-relaxation smoothing outperform Jacobi smoothing. While all of the tested methods converge in a mesh-independent number of iterations, none of them behaves completely independent of the polynomial order. When multigrid is used as a preconditioner in a Krylov method, the iteration number decreases significantly compared with using multigrid as a solver. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the properties of smoothers in the context of algebraic multigrid (AMG) running on parallel computers with potentially millions of processors. The development of multigrid smoothers in this case is challenging, because some of the best relaxation schemes, such as the Gauss–Seidel (GS) algorithm, are inherently sequential. Based on the sharp two-grid multigrid theory from [R. D. Falgout and P. S. Vassilevski, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 42 (2004), pp. 1669–1693] and [R. D. Falgout, P. S. Vassilevski, and L. T. Zikatanov, Numer. Linear Algebra Appl., 12 (2005), pp. 471–494] we characterize the smoothing properties of a number of practical candidates for parallel smoothers, including several C-F , polynomial, and hybrid schemes. We show, in particular, that the popular hybrid GS algorithm has multigrid smoothing properties which are independent of the number of processors in many practical applications, provided that the problem size per processor is large enough. This is encouraging news for the scalability of AMG on ultraparallel computers. We also introduce the more robust 1 smoothers, which are always convergent and have already proven essential for the parallel solution of some electromagnetic problems [T. Kolev and P. Vassilevski, J. Comput. Math., 27 (2009), pp. 604–623].},

In the context of unstructured meshes, however, maintaining good parallel eﬃciency is diﬃcult with multiplicative iterative methods such as Gauss-Seidel. This leads us to consider alternative smoothers. We discuss the computational advantages of polynomial smoothers within parallel multigrid algorithms for positive deﬁnite symmetric systems. Two particular polynomials are considered: Chebyshev and a multilevel speciﬁc polynomial. The advantages of polynomial smoothing over traditional smoothers such as Gauss-Seidel are illustrated on several applications: Poisson’s equation, thin-body elasticity, and eddy current approximations to Maxwell’s equations. While parallelizing the Gauss-Seidel method typically involves a compromise between a scalable convergence rate and maintaining high ﬂop rates, polynomial smoothers achieve parallel scalable multigrid convergence rates without sacriﬁcing ﬂop rates. We show that, although parallel computers are the main motivation, polynomial smoothers are often surprisingly competitive with Gauss-Seidel smoothers on serial machines.},

The resulting methods are a viable alternative to finite difference and finite element methods for these problems. Spectral methods are particularly attractive for problems in several space dimensions in which high accuracy is required. These methods are based on representing the solution to a problem as a truncated series of smooth functions of the independent variables. Whereas finite element methods are based on expansions in local basis functions, spectral methods are based on expansions in global functions. Spectral methods are the extension of the standard technique of separation of variables to the solution of arbitrarily complicated problems. The chapter illustrates spectral methods for the simple one-dimensional heat equation. The chapter also discusses the difficulty caused by nontrivial boundary conditions and the difficulty of treating nonlinear and nonconstant coefficient terms. It then summarizes the properties of spectral methods for problems in simple geometries and explains how spectral methods can be extended to problems in complicated geometries.},

	abstract = {Driven by the need to solve linear systems arising from problems posed on extremely large, unstructured grids, there has been a recent resurgence of interest in algebraic multigrid (AMG). AMG is attractive in that it holds out the possibility of multigrid-like performance on unstructured grids. The sheer size of many modern physics and simulation problems has led to the development of massively parallel computers, and has sparked much research into developing algorithms for them. Parallelizing AMG is a difficult task, however. While much of the AMG method parallelizes readily, the process of coarse-grid selection, in particular, is fundamentally sequential in nature. We have previously introduced a parallel algorithm [A.J. Cleary, R.D. Falgout, V.E. Henson, J.E. Jones, in: Proceedings of the Fifth International Symposium on Solving Irregularly Structured Problems in Parallel, Springer, New York, 1998] for the selection of coarse-grid points, based on modifications of certain parallel independent set algorithms and the application of heuristics designed to insure the quality of the coarse grids, and shown results from a prototype serial version of the algorithm. In this paper we describe an implementation of a parallel AMG code, using the algorithm of A.J. Cleary, R.D. Falgout, V.E. Henson, J.E. Jones [in: Proceedings of the Fifth International Symposium on Solving Irregularly Structured Problems in Parallel, Springer, New York, 1998] as well as other approaches to parallelizing the coarse-grid selection. We consider three basic coarsening schemes and certain modifications to the basic schemes, designed to address specific performance issues. We present numerical results for a broad range of problem sizes and descriptions, and draw conclusions regarding the efficacy of the method. Finally, we indicate the current directions of the research.},

	abstract = {The solution of large sparse linear systems arises in many applications, such as computational fluid dynamics and oil reservoir simulation. In realistic cases the matrices are often so large that they require large scale distributed parallel computing to obtain the solution of interest in a reasonable time. In this paper we discuss the design and implementation of the AmgX library, which provides drop-in GPU acceleration of distributed algebraic multigrid (AMG) and preconditioned iterative methods. The AmgX library implements both classical and aggregation-based AMG methods with different selector and interpolation strategies, along with a variety of smoothers and preconditioners, including block-Jacobi, Gauss--Seidel, and incomplete-LU factorization. The library contains many of the standard and flexible preconditioned Krylov subspace iterative methods, which can be combined with any of the available multigrid methods or simpler preconditioners. The parallelism in the aggregation scheme exploits parallel graph matching techniques, while the smoothers and preconditioners often rely on parallel graph coloring algorithms. The AMG algorithm implemented in the AmgX library achieves \$2\$--\$5{\textbackslash}times\$ speedup on a single GPU against a competitive implementation on the CPU. As will be shown in the numerical experiments section, both setup and solve phases scale well across multiple nodes, sustaining this performance advantage.},

The computational domain covers the case of classical single-domain spectral approximations (see [C. Canuto et al., Spectral Methods. Fundamentals in Single Domains, Springer, Heidelberg, 2006]), as well as that of more general spectral-element methods in which the preconditioners are expressed in terms of local (upon every element) algebraic solvers. The primal spectral approximation is based on the Galerkin approach with numerical integration (G-NI) at the Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto (LGL) nodes in the domain. The preconditioning matrices rely on either \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{P\}\_1\$, \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Q\}\_1\$, or \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Q\}\_\{1,NI\}\$ (i.e., with numerical integration) finite elements on meshes whose vertices coincide with the LGL nodes used for the spectral approximation. The analysis highlights certain preconditioners, which yield the solution at an overall cost proportional to \$N{\textasciicircum}\{d+1\}\$, where N denotes the polynomial degree in each direction.},

The crucial aspect of local Fourier analysis is that it can be used to minimize an estimate of the spectral radius of a stationary iteration, or the condition number of a preconditioned system, in terms of a symbol representation of the algorithm. In practice, this is a ``minimax"" problem, minimizing with respect to solver parameters the appropriate measure of solver work, which involves maximizing over the Fourier frequency. Often, several algorithmic parameters may be determined by local Fourier analysis in order to obtain efficient algorithms. Analytical solutions to minimax problems are rarely possible beyond simple problems; the status quo in local Fourier analysis involves grid sampling, which is prohibitively expensive in high dimensions. In this paper, we propose and explore optimization algorithms to solve these problems efficiently. Several examples, with known and unknown analytical solutions, are presented to show the effectiveness of these approaches.},

In order to resolve this difficulty, we recently introduced the weighted Jacobi-type iteration which has a weight parameter and a scaling diagonal matrix, and proposed the optimization technique for its weight parameter. As its efficient development, in this paper, we propose an auto-tuning technique not only for the weight parameter but also for the scaling diagonal matrix of the weighted Jacobi-type iteration used for preconditioners. The numerical experiments indicate that our auto-tuning technique is well played to solve very large linear systems.},

	abstract = {We develop an all-hex meshing strategy for the interstitial space in beds of densely packed spheres that is tailored to turbulent ﬂow simulations based on the spectral element method (SEM). The SEM achieves resolution through elevated polynomial order N and requires two to three orders of magnitude fewer elements than standard ﬁnite element approaches do. These reduced element counts place stringent requirements on mesh quality and conformity. Our meshing algorithm is based on a Voronoi decomposition of the sphere centers. Facets of the Voronoi cells are tessellated into quads that are swept to the sphere surface to generate a high-quality base mesh. Reﬁnements to the algorithm include edge collapse to remove slivers, node insertion to balance resolution, localized reﬁnement in the radial direction about each sphere, and mesh optimization. We demonstrate geometries with 102–105 spheres using ≈ 300 elements per sphere (for three radial layers), along with mesh quality metrics, timings, ﬂow simulations, and solver performance.},

    abstract = { Abstract The Poisson pressure solve resulting from the spectral element discretization of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation requires fast, robust, and scalable preconditioning. In the current work, a parallel scaling study of Chebyshevaccelerated Schwarz and Jacobi preconditioning schemes is presented, with special focus on GPU architectures, such as OLCF's Summit. Convergence properties of the Chebyshevaccelerated schemes are compared with alternative methods, such as low-order preconditioners combined with algebraic multigrid. Performance and scalability results are presented for a variety of preconditioner and solver settings. The authors demonstrate that Chebyshev-accelerated-Schwarz methods provide a robust and effective smoothing strategy when using p-multigrid as a preconditioner in a Krylovsubspace projector. The variety of cases to be addressed, on a wide range of processor counts, suggests that performance can be enhanced by automated run-time selection of the preconditioner and associated parameters. }
